                <h1>Suggestions for JJ</h1>
                In order to <strong>maximize</strong> your <strong>profits</strong>, I would make sure of a couple things. Firstly, the movie must be released during
                <strong>Christmas</strong> time. Three of the four Star Wars movies of this generation have been released during Christmas, and those three are the
                <strong>best performers</strong>. Star Wars works well as a Christmas event, as families are together and can go see it, increasing revenue. You can 
                also <strong>sell</strong> much more <strong>merchandise</strong> due to the nature of the holidays. 
                <br><br>
                The next thing to do is to <strong>diversify</strong> your cast. Rogue One had a great cast, full of wonderful actors, and only the lead female
                was white. The rest of the actors are Chinese, Mexican, Pakistani, and a whole other host of cultures. <strong>Representation matters</strong>, 
                and it is clear when comparing Rogue One's box office to The Last Jedi, and episodical film that only outperformed it by a little.
                <br><br>
                It is also important to focus <strong>advertisement</strong> heavily in the <strong>USA</strong> and <strong>UK</strong>. These are the top two performing countries for box office, so
                they should be prioritized. Australia and China are also quite large as well, so providing a lot of focus there would be great.
                <br><br>
                A Star Wars film should also be dense. The Force Awakens and Rogue One are the two top performers for the new films. Both of these 
                barely give you a break to think. They are <strong>paced</strong> very <strong>quickly</strong>, moving from one place to the next. This keeps you engaged and actively
                interested. Both of these have the highest percentage of planets shown out of the new films. These two are also about two hours and fifteen minutes long, whereas The 
                Last Jedi clocks in at around two and a half hours. These extra fifteen minutes, if not used well, can <strong>put people off</strong> returning for another viewing.
